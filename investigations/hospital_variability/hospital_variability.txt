Which procedures have the greatest variability between hospitals?

MEASURE_ID	STD_DEV_SCORE
STK_4		  22.286
ED_2b		  21.527
OP_23		  21.138
VTE_5		  17.438
OP_2		  16.951
HF_2		  16.821
OP_3b		  16.661
IMM_3_FAC_ADHPCT  16.293
OP_20	       	  15.658
OP_21		  15.644

Where:
STK_4		 = Thrombolytic Therapy
ED_2b		 = Admit Decision Time to ED Departure Time for Admitted Patients
OP_23		 = Head CT Scan Results for Acute Ischemic Stroke or Hemorrhagic Stroke Patients
VTE_5		 = Venous Thromboembolism Warfarin Therapy Discharge Instructions
OP_2		 = Fibrinolytic Therapy Received Within 30 Minutes of ED Arrival
HF_2		 = Evaluation of LVS Function
OP_3b		 = Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention - Reporting Rate
IMM_3_FAC_ADHPCT = Healthcare Personnel Influenza Vaccination
OP_20	       	 = Median Time from ED Arrival to Provider Contact for ED Patietns
OP_21		 = Median Time to Pain Management for Long Bone Fracture

The above list of procedures that have the greatest variability was created by calculating the standard deviation of the score for procedures in the effective care table. I ranked these scores in descending order to get the top 10 procedures. The procedure representing the greatest amount of variability between hospitals is STK_4, thrombolytic therapy, with a standard deviation of 22.286.

I used the score variable from the effective care table because if represents the percentage of hospital patrons who receive treatments known to get the best results for certain common, serious medical conditions or surgical procedures. Therefore, the procedure with the largest standard deviation of this score will represent the procedure or treatment that has the greatest variability between hospitals.
